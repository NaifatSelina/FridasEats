# Fridas' Eats- Project Portfolio 4- Full Stack Toolkit.

<!--summary paragraph-->
Fridas’ Eats is an independently established restaurant that is family owned and ran. The restaurant was founded by Aisha Said and it located in the heart of London. When customers want to visit the cozy and chic restaurant that focuses on serving authentic Zanzibari foods, they can go to the webpage and book themselves in for a reservation. Customers who are accessing the webpage will see a visually appealing front-end website which shows users information about Fridas’ Eats, allows customers to create an account, make a booking, write a review and contact the restaurant, amongst other exciting things. The other half of the website acts as a management system for staff members. If an account has the correct permissions, the staff member will be able to manage everything related to Fridas’ Eats such as bookings, reviews and payments.

<!--project aim-->
## Project Aim
For my fourth project I decided to create a webpage for a potential business idea that my relative has, therefore, I had to ensure the webpage was professional, practical for actual use, authentic to the goals and aesthetics of the business and made with a high attention to detail. To reach this objective I will be using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Javascript, Python, and the Django Framework, ensuring to test throughout to monitor bugs and inefficiencies in my code.

## User Experience

### Design Wireframes
To design the Fridas’ Eats webpage I decided to use Balsamiq to create the design wireframes. I decided when creating these design wireframes that I would focus more on the actual structure of the different webpages, navigating the proportions of the pages and where I want each element positions as opposed to the aesthetics such as font and colour. The reason for this was because having the structure aids significantly in the development process and adds ease. This is the reason the wireframe colours and fonts may not completely identify with those presented in the final product. However, the wireframes are definitely a very important and vital initial step in the development of all my projects- this one included.

- In future webpages for mobile screens I would vastly simplify the layout of the quiz so the performance can be faster on mobile devices.

### Responsive Design Checker. 
![Responsive Design Checker](assets/images/Responsive%20Design%20Checker.png)
- Although I checked responsiveness of the webpage with Am I Responsive? and Lighthouse Testing, I also decided to ensure the webpage was responsive by further checking with Responsive Design Checker.

### JsHint.
